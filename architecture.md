# EquityPulse: Stock News in Brief - Architecture Document

## 1. App Overview

EquityPulse is a concise stock news app, similar to Inshorts but focused exclusively on stock market news. Each news item will be presented in just 60 words, providing users with quick, digestible stock market updates.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for modern, declarative UI
- **Local Database**: Room for persistent storage
- **Remote Data**: Retrofit for API calls
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger 2
- **Concurrency**: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, Espresso
- **API Services**: Financial news APIs (options: Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Yahoo Finance)

## 4. Core Features

1. **News Feed**: Concise 60-word stock news summaries
2. **Stock Tracking**: Follow specific stocks and get personalized news
3. **Categorized News**: Filter by sectors, indices, or news type
4. **Bookmarks**: Save important news for later reading
5. **Notifications**: Alerts for breaking news on followed stocks
6. **Search**: Find news about specific companies or topics
7. **Offline Mode**: Access previously loaded content offline

## 5. Database Schema

**News Table:**
- id (Primary Key)
- title
- content (60-word summary)
- originalUrl
- imageUrl
- publishDate
- source
- relatedStockSymbols (comma-separated)
- category
- isBookmarked

**Stocks Table:**
- symbol (Primary Key)
- name
- isFollowed
- currentPrice
- priceChange
- priceChangePercentage
- lastUpdated

## 6. API Integration

The app will need to integrate with financial news APIs and possibly stock price data APIs. Options include:
- Alpha Vantage
- Finnhub
- Yahoo Finance API
- MarketStack

The integration will fetch:
- Latest news articles related to stocks
- Stock price data for tracked stocks
- Market indices data

## 7. Scalability Considerations

- **API Abstraction Layer**: The remote data sources will be abstracted behind interfaces, allowing for new service endpoints to be added
- **Repository Pattern**: Repositories will handle the coordination of data from various sources, making it easy to integrate new data providers
- **Use Case Design**: Business logic will be encapsulated in use cases, which can be updated or extended to incorporate new data flows
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger will facilitate swapping or adding new service implementations
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement effective caching to reduce API calls
- **Pagination**: Load news in chunks to handle large datasets
- **Workmanager**: Schedule background data sync
- **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled for future expansion
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags for A/B testing and gradual rollouts

## 8. Future Microservices Integration

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tech |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| News Collector | Scrape/aggregate from 50+ sources | **Python Flask/FastAPI** with **Scrapy** for web scraping, **Apache Kafka** for message queuing, and **Redis** for caching. Deployed on **Docker** containers for scalability. |
| Real-Time Processor | Analyze sentiment/trends | **Python** with **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for NLP models, **Apache Spark** for distributed processing, and **Elasticsearch** for fast querying of analyzed data. **Kubernetes** for orchestration. |

## 9. Integration Architecture

To ensure simplicity while maintaining scalability:

1. **API Gateway Pattern**: Implement a lightweight API gateway that routes requests to the appropriate microservice
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Use message queues for asynchronous communication between services
3. **Contract-First Development**: Define clear API contracts between the mobile app and backend services
4. **Feature Toggles**: Use configuration flags to enable/disable features based on available microservices

## 10. Development Approach

We'll follow Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1. Write unit tests first
2. Implement code to pass those tests
3. Refactor for optimization while maintaining test compliance

## 11. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For business logic, repositories, and ViewModels
- **Integration Tests**: For database operations and API interactions
- **UI Tests**: For user interactions and screen navigation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full user flows
