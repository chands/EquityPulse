# EquityPulse Project Summary

## Current State Overview
EquityPulse is an Android application for delivering concise stock market news (60 words or less), built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app follows MVVM with Clean Architecture and uses Room for local storage, Retrofit for networking, and Dagger for dependency injection.

## Recent Enhancements
1. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced launcher icon with larger gold coin background and Rupee symbol
   - Improved app-wide card styling with consistent elevation and colors
   - Added responsive TopAppBar with auto-hide functionality in landscape mode
   - Implemented tap-to-show feature for navigation components

2. **Code Structure**
   - Added new components: ErrorComponent and NewsItem
   - Improved HomeScreen, NewsDetailScreen, and SettingsScreen implementations
   - Enhanced animations for better user experience
   - Fixed layout issues in landscape orientation

3. **Project Planning**
   - Added comprehensive development roadmap to README.md with phased approach:
     - Phase 1: Core Improvements (API, Performance, Testing)
     - Phase 2: Feature Expansion (Portfolio tracking, News filtering, Offline)
     - Phase 3: UX Enhancement (UI refinement, Personalization, Social)
     - Phase 4: Advanced Features (Analytics, Performance, Scalability)

## Next Development Steps
Starting with Phase 1 priorities:

1. **API Integration Enhancement**
   - Replace hardcoded API key (currently in Constants.kt) with secure storage
   - Implement proper error handling for API rate limits
   - Add retry policy for network failures

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement pagination for news feed (initial implementation needed)
   - Optimize database queries and add indices

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Increase test coverage, particularly for repositories and view models
   - Current test coverage is minimal and focused on UseCases

## Architecture Notes
- **Current Pattern**: MVVM with Clean Architecture
  - Presentation: Compose UI, ViewModels
  - Domain: UseCases, Repository Interfaces
  - Data: Repository Implementations, Local & Remote Data Sources

- **Directory Structure**:

## API Integration
- Currently using Alpha Vantage API (key in Constants.kt)
- Endpoints implemented:
  - News sentiment
  - Stock quotes
  - Company overviews
  - Time series data

## Known Issues
- Hardcoded API key should be moved to secure storage
- Limited error handling for network failures
- No pagination implemented for loading more news items
- Potential layout issues in certain screen sizes
